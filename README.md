# kolam-a-day

Draw a Kolam a day using the pattern generated by this code. A new pattern is generated every day.

If this is your first time drawing a Kolam, follow the instructions in the zine. 

You'll need a handy printer to draw Kolams daily unless you own a tablet to draw them directly using a stylus.

## What is a Kolam?
Kolam is a South-Indian folk art form - a single continuous line drawing that creates winding, interwoven, geometric patterns over a two-dimensional dot-grid structure. For more background, see this [article](https://alpaca.pubpub.org/pub/xywz3ebv/release/1)

## How long does it take to draw a Kolam?
Drawing a 10x10 dot grid kolam should take no more than 10 minutes. The higher the grid resolution, the longer it takes. 

## Why draw Kolams?
Drawing a Kolam can be a meditative experience, something you can do daily to build focus or find a moment of rest.
